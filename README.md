# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\


### `npm run build`

To run a production build, run the following command: 'npm run build'

### `npm run eject`
Warning: Ejecting is irreversible!

If you're unhappy with the default configuration in Create React App, you can use npm run eject to gain full control. It copies all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project, letting you customize them. Keep in mind that this is a one-way operation, and there's no going back. You don't have to eject, but it's there when you need it. For detailed instructions, see the official Create React App documentation.
