If you're unhappy with the default configuration in Create React App, you can use npm run eject to gain full control. It copies all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project, letting you customize them. Keep in mind that this is a one-way operation, and there's no going back. You don't have to eject, but it's there when you need it. For detailed instructions, see the official Create React App documentation.
